Firstly its name is presetted as lofi player as i used it for lofi music , you can change it simply by editing in html code , line 4 to change title , line 11 to change name on web page.

Secondly You have to create two folders named img and music. Now rename the song's name into song1,song2,song3,song4,song5,song6,song7,song8,song9,song10 & place all the songs into the music folder. Do the same process for images too.

thirdly create a HTML file named "index.html" and copy-paste the code given in this repository or else just download file from this repository
same for JS and CSS file. jss file will be named "script.js" and CSS file will be named "style.css".
HTML code already has everything linked.

fourthly Make sure to have all 3 files at same place.

it should be working now , go ahead and enjoy !
